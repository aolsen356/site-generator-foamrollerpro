          <div class="content-main">
            <h2 id="density">Density Ratings</h2>
            <p>Foam density is the most critical specification when selecting a roller. Density determines pressure intensity, durability, and suitability for different experience levels and recovery goals.</p>

            <h3>Soft Density (15-25 PSI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Beginners, seniors, individuals with low pain tolerance, gentle recovery sessions</p>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> High compressibility, less intense pressure, shorter lifespan (6-12 months with regular use)</p>
            <p><strong>Typical materials:</strong> Standard EVA foam, low-density polyethylene</p>
            <p>Soft rollers compress easily under body weight, providing a gentler introduction to self-myofascial release. While excellent for learning proper technique, they may not provide sufficient pressure for experienced users or those with significant muscle tension.</p>

            <h3>Medium Density (25-40 PSI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Intermediate users, general fitness enthusiasts, post-workout recovery</p>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Balanced pressure and comfort, good durability (12-24 months), versatile applications</p>
            <p><strong>Typical materials:</strong> EPP (expanded polypropylene), medium-density EVA</p>
            <p>Medium density represents the sweet spot for most users. Provides effective myofascial release without excessive discomfort. Suitable for both pre-workout mobility and post-workout recovery protocols.</p>

            <h3>Firm Density (40-60 PSI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Advanced users, athletes, individuals with chronic muscle tension</p>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Deep tissue penetration, minimal compression, excellent durability (2-3+ years)</p>
            <p><strong>Typical materials:</strong> High-density EPP, molded EVA, PVC core construction</p>
            <p>Firm rollers maintain their shape under heavy pressure, allowing for intensive trigger point work. The increased density provides superior fascial release but requires adaptation period for new users.</p>

            <h3>Extra Firm Density (60+ PSI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Professional athletes, physical therapy settings, maximum pressure applications</p>
            <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Minimal give, intense pressure, professional-grade durability (3-5+ years)</p>
            <p><strong>Typical materials:</strong> PVC core with EVA coating, ultra-high-density EPP</p>
            <p>Extra firm rollers provide the most aggressive tissue work. These are nearly incompressible and deliver maximum mechanical pressure. Not recommended for beginners due to intensity.</p>

            <div class="callout">
              <div class="callout-title">Selection Tip</div>
              <p>If uncertain between two density levels, choose the firmer option. You can always modulate pressure by adjusting body position and support, but you cannot increase the maximum pressure of a soft roller.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="sizing">Size Selection</h2>

            <h3>Length Considerations</h3>
            <p><strong>12" (Compact):</strong> Travel-friendly, targeted muscle work, single-limb rolling. Ideal for gym bags and carry-on luggage. Limited surface area makes full-back rolling difficult.</p>

            <p><strong>18" (Standard):</strong> Most versatile length. Handles all major muscle groups effectively. Balances portability with functionality. Recommended for most users as a first roller.</p>

            <p><strong>24" (Mid-Length):</strong> Better stability for back rolling. Accommodates wider body frames. Still reasonably portable. Excellent for users over 6 feet tall.</p>

            <p><strong>36" (Full-Length):</strong> Maximum stability for thoracic spine work. Can roll entire back simultaneously. Allows for bilateral leg rolling (both legs at once). Less portable but superior for home use.</p>

            <h3>Diameter Considerations</h3>
            <p><strong>4" (Narrow):</strong> Increased pressure due to smaller surface area. More challenging balance requirements. Better for targeted, deep tissue work.</p>

            <p><strong>5-5.5" (Standard):</strong> Optimal balance of pressure and stability. Recommended diameter for most applications. Suitable for all experience levels.</p>

            <p><strong>6" (Wide):</strong> Greater stability, gentler pressure distribution. Easier balance for beginners. Better surface contact for larger muscle groups like quadriceps and back.</p>

            <h2 id="surface">Surface Texture</h2>

            <h3>Smooth Surface</h3>
            <p>Traditional smooth foam provides even, consistent pressure across the contact area. Ideal for broad muscle groups and general rolling. Easy to clean and maintain. May be more comfortable for beginners and sensitive areas.</p>

            <h3>Textured/Grooved Surface</h3>
            <p>Patterns of ridges, bumps, or channels designed to mimic massage therapist techniques. Can enhance trigger point release and provide varied pressure stimulation. Popular options include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Grid pattern:</strong> Alternating firm and hollow zones for variable pressure</li>
              <li><strong>Longitudinal grooves:</strong> Channels that run the length of the roller to reduce direct pressure on bones</li>
              <li><strong>Raised bumps:</strong> Discrete nodules for aggressive trigger point work</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hybrid Designs</h3>
            <p>Some rollers feature multiple zones with different textures. For example, smooth ends with a textured center section. These provide versatility but may compromise effectiveness in each specific application.</p>

            <div class="callout">
              <div class="callout-title">Clinical Perspective</div>
              <p>Research shows minimal performance difference between smooth and textured surfaces for myofascial release outcomes. Choose based on personal comfort preference rather than assumed therapeutic superiority.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="materials">Material Types</h2>

            <h3>EVA Foam (Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate)</h3>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Lightweight, cost-effective, comfortable initial feel, widely available</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Degrades faster, loses firmness over time, can develop flat spots, lower durability</p>
            <p><strong>Typical lifespan:</strong> 6-18 months depending on density and usage frequency</p>

            <h3>EPP Foam (Expanded Polypropylene)</h3>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Superior durability, maintains shape and firmness, better compression resistance, moisture-resistant</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher initial cost, firmer feel (may be intense for beginners)</p>
            <p><strong>Typical lifespan:</strong> 2-4 years with regular use</p>

            <h3>PVC Core with Foam Coating</h3>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely durable, maintains firmness indefinitely, professional-grade construction, high weight capacity</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Heaviest option, most expensive, may be too firm for some users</p>
            <p><strong>Typical lifespan:</strong> 5+ years, often lifetime durability</p>

            <h3>Hollow Core Construction</h3>
            <p>Many modern rollers feature a hollow core (air cavity) with external foam layer. This design reduces weight while maintaining firmness. The rigid exterior prevents collapse under pressure. Common in textured rollers like the TriggerPoint GRID series.</p>

            <h2 id="features">Advanced Features</h2>

            <h3>Vibration Technology</h3>
            <p>Battery-powered vibration motors (typically 30-60 Hz frequency) provide additional neuromuscular benefits. Research suggests vibration can enhance acute flexibility gains and may reduce rolling discomfort. Premium feature with 3-4x cost premium. Consider for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Advanced athletes seeking cutting-edge recovery tools</li>
              <li>Users with significant muscle tension who need additional stimulus</li>
              <li>Those willing to invest in technology-enhanced recovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contoured/Ergonomic Designs</h3>
            <p>Some rollers feature non-cylindrical shapes with curves, channels, or asymmetric profiles. Designed to accommodate spinal anatomy and provide targeted pressure. Examples include spine-friendly grooves or multi-diameter construction. Benefits are user-specific; try before purchasing if possible.</p>

            <h3>Portable/Collapsible Designs</h3>
            <p>Some models collapse or disassemble for travel. Hollow-core designs with removable end caps that allow internal storage of small items. Convenient for frequent travelers but may sacrifice some structural integrity.</p>

            <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations by User Type</h2>

              <div class="callout-title">Cost-Effectiveness Analysis</div>
              <p>A $50 high-quality roller that lasts 3 years ($16.67/year) represents better value than a $20 budget roller requiring replacement every 8 months ($30/year). Invest in durability for long-term cost savings.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

            <h4>Weight Capacity</h4>
            <p>Most quality rollers support 250-500 lbs. Check specifications if you exceed 250 lbs or plan aggressive two-limb rolling. PVC core construction offers highest weight capacity (500+ lbs).</p>

            <h4>Maintenance Requirements</h4>
            <p>Foam rollers require minimal maintenance. Wipe with damp cloth after use. Avoid prolonged sun exposure which can degrade foam. Store in cool, dry location. Higher-density materials require less care and resist degradation.</p>

            <h4>Warranty Coverage</h4>
            <p>Quality manufacturers offer 1-3 year warranties. This indicates confidence in durability and provides protection against defects. Avoid products without warranty coverage.</p>

            <h4>Environmental Considerations</h4>
            <p>EPP foam is recyclable and more environmentally friendly than EVA. Some manufacturers use recycled materials. PVC contains plasticizers; consider eco-impact if this is a priority.</p>
